<p>
Information about safari timings and duration in Ranthambore National Park is very important for all those planning to visit Ranthambore. The forest of Ranthambore is divided into 10 different zones for safari. By the way, all 10 safari zones of Ranthambore National Park are open for wildlife safari from 1 October to 30 June every year as per the entry time of the special season. But even in monsoon (July to September), 6 to 10 zones of the park are open for tourists for jungle safari.
</p>

<p>
The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve has a jungle safari scheduled for visitors twice a day, one safari starts in the morning and another safari late in the afternoon. Usually, the time for opening and closing the park gate for jungle safari is according to sunrise and sunset. Typically, the park opens half an hour after sunrise for the morning safari and closes half an hour before sunset in the afternoon safari. Consequently, the duration of the jungle safari at Ranthambore is approximately three to three and a half hours in each shift.
</p>

<p>
It is important to remember the time of the jungle safari during the visit to Ranthambore, as the forest department gives strict instructions to follow the safari time.  As the time of sunrise and sunset changes with the change of seasons in Ranthambore, the time of entry and exit of safari in Ranthambore National Park also changes.
